MIT Simulator 2014
==================

What if you were placed in the role of a certain unnamed Dean at MIT, in charge of handling issues as they pop up on campus?

***

Installing and Running
======================

First, follow the Haxe Flixel [Getting Started](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/) guide to install Haxe Flixel. Try it with a hello world program to make sure that it works.

Then, from a command prompt in the root directory, run

```
lime test flash
```

or 

```
lime test neko
```

to compile and run the project.

Alternatively,

```
lime build flash
```

and then load up `index.html` in a browser.

Coding Guidelines
=================

Please remember to document your code. Haxe appears to use [Javadoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc), so please follow suit.

Also, be sure to claim tasks on the [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HsnBgHrZJ06tlcsktJfT4Nqqw7B7NsfWRaXu8VK6T7o/edit) before starting to code!
